These custom commands are meant to be used alongside bumpbot

## 10m interval

- edits channel name every 10m to show when you can bump your server.

## bump command

- gives rep if user bumps at correct time

- edits channel name to a timer

- sends an execCC to edit the channel name once the timer has ended

## sticky message

- always sends sticky message to assigned channel

- deletes message if not correct channel / if not correct time

## Disboard Bullshit
-we are not allowed to give __roles as rewards__ for bumps.  

Disboard does not have the power to forbid that but will remove you from their service if you do so.

## #BlameDisboard with this bullshit here
