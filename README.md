# YAGPDB.xyz
My plan for this github is to make it an easy to go to place for newbies to YAGPDB.xyz's custom commands. I plan to upload many easy to use custom commands here. I also have a testing folder for everyone to see if they would like to learn from them. If you have any questions feel free to contact me via Discord: **DZ#6669 (438789314101379072)**. I am entirely willing to make custom commands for users in return for Nitro or some other form of payment that piques my curiosity.
## Current Custom Commands
*As of right now these are the current commands I have or plan to create:*
- [x] Bump System
- [x] Tutorial - waitResponse Example
- [ ] Banned Words System

- [ ] Suggestion System
